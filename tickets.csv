IPN-58,Report export to PDF generates corrupted files (Key: IPN-58),"Reports exported to PDF cannot be opened.

Business impact: This issue affects revenue as users are unable to complete transactions. Several complaints have already been raised by enterprise customers, putting the client relationship at risk.

Technical details: Log analysis indicates possible race conditions or database deadlocks, which might explain why the system behaves differently under varying load conditions. Developers suspect unoptimized queries are at fault.

Additional observations: Users have reported inconsistent behavior where the error sometimes resolves on its own after multiple retries. However, this is not reliable and has caused significant frustration among end users."
